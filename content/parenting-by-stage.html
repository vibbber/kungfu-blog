      <p class="deck">What worked last year might be the exact thing holding your kid back today.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Opening -->
    <p class="body-text">
      Here's a strange fact about parenting: the thing you're doing right at age 5 can become the thing you're doing wrong at age 12. Not because you got lazy. Because your kid's brain rewired itself while you were still running the old playbook.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      Developmental research is pretty clear on this. Children don't just get bigger -- they fundamentally change how they think, feel, and relate to you at predictable intervals. And at each stage, there's a specific trap that catches well-meaning parents. The trap isn't neglect or abuse. It's <strong>doing too much of the right thing at the wrong time</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
      Five stages. Five traps. Here's what catches people off guard at each one -- and the move that actually works.
    </p>

    <!-- Stage 1: Ages 2-4 -->
    <div class="stage-card">
      <span class="age-tag">Ages 2-4</span>
      <h3>The Boundary Builders</h3>
      <p class="stage-sub">They can't hold two feelings at once. They're either happy or the world is ending.</p>

      <div class="trap-move">
        <div class="trap-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Trap</div>
          Treating a toddler who hits like they need emotional therapy instead of a boundary. Over-explaining feelings to a brain that can't process the explanation yet.
        </div>
        <div class="move-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Move</div>
          Short. Clear. Done. They desperately want your approval -- use that. When they share or wait their turn, let your face light up.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="script">"We don't hit. That hurts." Then follow with a consequence. Save the long explanations for later years.</div>

      <ul class="quick-list">
        <li>Protect free play -- a cardboard box beats an expensive "brain-building" toy</li>
        <li>Show, don't tell -- they copy how you treat the barista, not what you lecture about</li>
        <li>Firm limits ARE how they learn self-control; going soft on hitting teaches nothing</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Stage 2: Ages 5-7 -->
    <div class="stage-card">
      <span class="age-tag">Ages 5-7</span>
      <h3>The Wide-Eyed Years</h3>
      <p class="stage-sub">They think in absolutes. One bad day means "I'm terrible at everything."</p>

      <div class="trap-move">
        <div class="trap-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Trap</div>
          Treating first grade like it matters for college admissions. Tracking metrics and performance for a 6-year-old who just wants to show you a drawing.
        </div>
        <div class="move-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Move</div>
          Chase their curiosity, not yours. If they're obsessed with bugs or forts or making up songs, go with it -- even if it's not what you imagined.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="script">"Today was rough with the spelling test. But remember how proud you were when you figured out that science project last week?"</div>

      <ul class="quick-list">
        <li>Correct what they did, not who they are</li>
        <li>Let development be uneven -- some read early, some don't</li>
        <li>Skip prizes for learning -- external rewards kill genuine interest</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Stage 3: Ages 8-11 -->
    <div class="stage-card">
      <span class="age-tag">Ages 8-11</span>
      <h3>The Reality Check</h3>
      <p class="stage-sub">They can finally hold two truths at once: "I'm good at art but struggle with reading."</p>

      <div class="trap-move">
        <div class="trap-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Trap</div>
          Grades, select teams, and competitive rankings enter the picture -- and parental intensity explodes. The more you make these the center of your relationship, the more you crowd out what actually builds a strong sense of self.
        </div>
        <div class="move-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Move</div>
          Give them real responsibilities. Dishes, laundry, helping with younger siblings. Being useful builds identity in ways grades never can.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="script">"I noticed you helped your friend when she was struggling with that project. That matters more than the grade."</div>

      <ul class="quick-list">
        <li>Character first, effort second, results third</li>
        <li>Show your own imperfections -- let them see that adults have weaknesses too</li>
        <li>Never cancel chores to make room for more studying -- sends exactly the wrong message</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- The shift callout -->
    <div class="callout">
      <p>The biggest parenting mistakes don't come from not caring enough.<br>They come from <strong>managing your own anxiety through your child</strong>.</p>
      <p class="callout-small">If you're obsessing over grades, rankings, or social status -- ask whose need you're actually serving.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Stage 4: Ages 12-14 -->
    <div class="stage-card">
      <span class="age-tag">Ages 12-14</span>
      <h3>The Great Push-Away</h3>
      <p class="stage-sub">They'll challenge your views, reject your taste, and criticize your choices. That's their job.</p>

      <div class="trap-move">
        <div class="trap-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Trap</div>
          When kids perform the "perfect child" role -- straight A's, packed schedule, upbeat social media -- while feeling hollow inside. They've learned to perform success rather than develop an identity.
        </div>
        <div class="move-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Move</div>
          Survive their criticism without falling apart. When you don't crumble, you teach them something powerful: nobody has to be perfect to be worthy.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="script">When they challenge your politics at dinner or question rules you've always had -- that's healthy. They're building a value system. Listen.</div>

      <ul class="quick-list">
        <li>Stay close even when they push -- too much freedom at this age is dangerous</li>
        <li>Stop calling coaches and teachers on their behalf -- let them handle it</li>
        <li>Their rejection of you is developmental, not a verdict on your parenting</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Stage 5: Ages 15-17 -->
    <div class="stage-card">
      <span class="age-tag">Ages 15-17</span>
      <h3>Becoming Themselves</h3>
      <p class="stage-sub">They're confident one day, lost the next. That's not inconsistency -- it's integration.</p>

      <div class="trap-move">
        <div class="trap-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Trap</div>
          Stepping in with resources and connections every time they face a consequence. When you remove the natural cost of bad decisions, you remove the exact thing that teaches judgment.
        </div>
        <div class="move-col">
          <div class="col-label">The Move</div>
          Talk to them like capable people who are still learning. Hold the line on consequences. Let reality be the teacher.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="script">"That didn't go the way you wanted. What would you do differently if you could rewind?"</div>

      <ul class="quick-list">
        <li>Let them experiment with identity -- changing hobbies, style, and opinions is how they figure out what's real</li>
        <li>College applications, job interviews, school projects need to be genuinely theirs</li>
        <li>Don't dismiss substance use as "just what teenagers do" -- early use is a real risk factor</li>
      </ul>

          <h4>Adjust, Don't Abandon</h4>
          <p>Your involvement should change shape, not disappear. A 4-year-old needs you to set the boundary. A 14-year-old needs you to hold it while they push.</p>

          <h4>Connection Before Correction</h4>
          <p>Discipline works better when the relationship is strong. Invest during calm times so you have something to draw on during hard ones.</p>

          <p>At every age, the biggest mistakes come from parents managing their own worry through their child. Whose need are you serving?</p>

          <p>The instinct to remove obstacles is strong and often loving. But struggle is where growth happens. Be nearby -- don't clear the path.</p>

      <p class="callout-small">The parent who adapts to where their child actually is -- not where they wish they were -- gives them the best shot at becoming themselves.</p>
