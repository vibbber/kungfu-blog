    <ul>
      <li>Kids raised with accurate thinking instead of reactive thinking develop stronger self-regulation and fewer anxiety patterns.</li>
      <li>The move: replace the distortion with something accurate -- not positive, just true. The version you'd tell a friend.</li>

    <div class="tldr-inside"><strong>Inside: </strong>4-step SCAN breakdown with self-prompts &middot; worked shoe-and-marker morning scenario &middot; 5-step progression from catching thoughts after to catching them live &middot; 3 gut-check questions</div>
  </div>

  <p>Picture this: your kid spills juice on the couch for the third time this week. Before the liquid even hits the cushion, a sentence fires in your brain.</p>

  <p><em>"He doesn't care about anything in this house."</em></p>

  <p>That sentence isn't an observation. It's a triggered thought -- automatic, emotionally charged, and wearing a very convincing disguise as a fact. And in the two seconds before you open your mouth, that thought has already decided what kind of parent you're about to be.</p>

  <p>Here's the thing nobody tells you: <strong>you're not reacting to your child. You're reacting to a thought about your child.</strong> And when you learn to catch the thought, something remarkable happens -- you get a choice.</p>

  <div class="callout">
    You're not reacting to your child.<br>
    You're reacting to a thought about your child --<br>
    and that thought is almost never the full picture.
    <span class="small">Cognitive behavioral research confirms: our reactions are driven by interpretation, not events.</span>
  </div>

  <h2>The Usual Suspects</h2>

  <p>Triggered thoughts come in flavors. Once you know the menu, you start recognizing what you're being served.</p>

  <div class="thought-gallery">
    <div class="thought-card">
      <div class="label">Catastrophe</div>
      <div class="text">"If I let this slide, they'll walk all over me forever."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="thought-card">
      <div class="label">Identity</div>
      <div class="text">"I'm completely failing at this. No good parent would feel this way."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="thought-card">
      <div class="label">All-or-Nothing</div>
      <div class="text">"Every single day is a fight with this kid."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="thought-card">
      <div class="label">Projection</div>
      <div class="text">"They're doing this on purpose to get under my skin."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="thought-card">
      <div class="label">Shame Spiral</div>
      <div class="text">"I lost it again -- they're going to remember this forever."</div>
    </div>
    <div class="thought-card">
      <div class="label">Scorecard</div>
      <div class="text">"I do everything for this family and nobody even notices."</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These all share one thing: they feel urgent, true, and final. They're none of those things. They're reflexes -- old stress patterns firing because your brain detected a threat. The threat isn't real. But the reaction it produces absolutely is.</p>

  <h2>Why This Happens</h2>

  <p>Neuroscience has found that parents who experienced difficult childhoods can have competing neural circuits fire at the same time when their own child is distressed. One system says <em>"move toward your child."</em> The other says <em>"protect yourself."</em> The collision produces a reaction that often surprises you as much as it does your kid.</p>

  <p>When stress activates your brain's threat-detection system, thinking becomes rigid and extreme. Words like "always," "never," and "every time" start showing up in your inner monologue. Those words are the tell. They mean you've crossed from observation into distortion.</p>

  <p>The good news: these patterns can be interrupted. Every single time.</p>

    <h2>Three-Second Gut Check</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Am I reacting to what my child just did, or to a story I'm telling myself about what it means?</li>
      <li>Would I respond this way if I'd slept well and had a calm day?</li>
      <li>Is the intensity of my reaction matching the size of this actual moment?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>How This Muscle Grows</h2>

  <p>You won't catch every thought in real time on day one. That's fine. The skill builds in layers.</p>

  <ul class="build-list">
    <li><strong>Start after, not during.</strong> Run the SCAN after things settle. Reviewing past triggers builds the muscle for catching them live.</li>
    <li><strong>Learn your rotation.</strong> Most of us have two or three signature thoughts that keep cycling. Once you know your greatest hits, they lose their power.</li>
    <li><strong>Let your body be the alarm.</strong> The thought fires before you notice it, but your body responds instantly -- jaw tightening, chest heat, shallow breathing. Those physical signals are your early warning system.</li>
    <li><strong>Repair out loud.</strong> When you catch yourself mid-reaction, say so: "I just snapped and that wasn't fair. Let me try again." This teaches your child that thoughts can be examined and course-corrected.</li>
    <li><strong>Shrink the gap.</strong> The goal isn't perfection. It's reducing the time between reaction and awareness. That gap gets smaller with practice -- and even a small gap changes everything.</li>
