    <h1>The Hardest Parenting Move<br>Is Doing Nothing</h1>
    <p>Your child is hurting. Your chest tightens. Your hand moves toward the phone. Here's why the brave move is to sit.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-container">

    <div class="tldr-box">
      <p class="tldr-anchor">Resilience isn't born. It's built — in the gap between pain and recovery.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kids raised with this approach handle disappointment without falling apart, trust their own problem-solving, and enter adulthood knowing that hard things pass.</li>
        <li>The move: name what they feel, sit in it without silver-lining, then turn the experience into signal once the wave passes.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tldr-inside"><strong>Inside: </strong>3 SIT steps with word-for-word scripts &middot; fixer vs. coach side-by-side &middot; 3 age-matched conversation cards &middot; 4 long-term habits to lock it in</div>
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      <p class="lead">Your kid comes home in tears. Didn't get picked. Got left out. Failed the thing they practiced for weeks. And your body reacts before your brain does: chest tightens, jaw clenches, hands itch to grab the phone and call someone. Fix it. Make it stop.</p>

      <p>That reflex? It feels like love. It looks like love. But every time you act on it, you send a quiet, devastating message: <em>You can't handle this.</em></p>

      <p>Now flip it. Imagine sitting down next to your crying child, saying nothing heroic, fixing nothing, just... being there. That sends the opposite message: <em>This is hard, and you're capable.</em></p>

      <p>The difference between those two messages, repeated a few thousand times across childhood, is the difference between a young adult who crumbles at the first sign of difficulty and one who knows from experience that hard things pass.</p>

    <p class="img-caption">The hardest seat in the house: right next to your child's pain, doing nothing about it.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>Your child doesn't need a pain-free life.<br>They need a parent who teaches them that pain is survivable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prose">
      <h2>Fixer vs. Coach</h2>
      <p>Most parents default to fixer mode. It stops the crying faster. It feels productive. But there's a cost.</p>
    </div>

    <table class="compare-table">
      <tr>
        <th>Fixer Mode</th>
        <th>Coach Mode</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Emails the teacher about the unfair grade</td>
        <td>Asks "What do you think happened?"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Calls the other parent when feelings get hurt</td>
        <td>Helps your child practice what to say</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Clears obstacles before they reach them</td>
        <td>Lets them bump into it: "What did you notice?"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Says "Don't worry, I'll handle it"</td>
        <td>Says "This is tough. What's your first move?"</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Child learns to wait for rescue</td>
        <td>Child learns to trust themselves</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <div class="prose">
      <p>Notice the pattern. Fixer mode is faster. Coach mode is harder. But coach mode is the only one that builds anything lasting.</p>

        <div class="sit-body">
          <h3>See it and say it</h3>
          <p>Name the emotion you're seeing. Don't analyze. Don't minimize. Don't try to talk them out of it. Just reflect what's in front of you.</p>
          <div class="script">"You're really disappointed about not getting picked. I can see that."</div>

        <h3>Be Their Translator</h3>
        <p>They feel enormous things but don't have words for them yet. You supply the vocabulary: name the face, name the fists, name the feeling. Do this enough and they start naming their own emotions — the first step of self-regulation.</p>

        <h3>Connect Thoughts to Feelings</h3>
        <p>School-age kids can begin to see the link between what they tell themselves and how they feel. Help them spot the internal narrative and test whether a different story changes the feeling.</p>

        <h3>Help Them Build Their Own Toolkit</h3>
        <p>Teenagers need to own their coping strategies, not borrow yours. Help them inventory what actually works — running, drawing, calling a specific friend — and what doesn't — doomscrolling, snapping at siblings, shutting everyone out. Your role shifts from coach to consultant: available when asked.</p>

        <h4>Narrate your own struggles out loud</h4>
        <p>"I didn't get the project I wanted at work. I'm disappointed, but I'm going to talk to my manager about what I can do differently next quarter." When kids hear you process difficulty without catastrophizing, they absorb that this is what capable people do.</p>

        <h4>Celebrate the comeback, not the comfort</h4>
        <p>"Remember last month when you were devastated about not making the relay team? You stuck with practice anyway, and look where you are now." Kids who hear their own comeback stories retold start to believe: <em>"I've done hard things before. I can do hard things again."</em></p>

        <h4>Process struggle when things are calm</h4>
        <p>The middle of a meltdown is no time for a lesson. But Tuesday night dinner? Perfect: "What was the hardest thing about your week? How did you get through it?" When processing struggle becomes routine, it stops feeling like a crisis every time.</p>

      <p>Comfort is presence. Rescue is removal.<br>One builds strength. The other builds dependence.<br>Your child needs you beside the struggle, not between them and it.</p>
