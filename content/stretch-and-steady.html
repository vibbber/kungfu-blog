    </div>

    <p>Here's something nobody tells you about raising a confident kid: it doesn't come from a single parenting style. It comes from switching between two.</p>

    <p>Think of it like driving. You wouldn't stay in first gear on the highway. You wouldn't downshift to fifth on a steep hill. Great parents shift gears constantly, all day long, based on what their kid is telling them right now.</p>

    <p>The two gears: <strong>Stretch</strong> (push them into the world) and <strong>Steady</strong> (be the place they come back to). Every kid needs both. Every single day.</p>

    <div class="golden-rule">
      <div class="label">The whole strategy in one line</div>
      <p>When they're calm and curious, stretch them forward.<br>When they're overwhelmed, be their steady ground.</p>

        <tr>

    <h2>Reading the Signals</h2>

    <p>Your kid is already broadcasting which gear they need. You just have to tune in.</p>

    <div class="signal-grid">
      <div class="signal-card stretch">
        <h4>Ready to stretch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Calm, curious, asking questions</li>
          <li>Reaching outward, wanting to try alone</li>
          <li>Looking at you for a nod before jumping in</li>
          <li>Energy is forward-facing</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="signal-card steady">
        <h4>Needs steadying</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Clingy, tearful, or withdrawn</li>
          <li>Aggressive or shutting down</li>
          <li>Body tense, overwhelmed</li>
          <li>Energy is pulling inward</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="accent-box">
      <h3>When You're Not Sure</h3>
      <p>Start with steady. Always. A child who feels safe will naturally reach outward again on their own. You can't push someone into confidence — but you can build the ground they launch from.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Stretch Mode in Action</h2>

    <img class="section-img" src="/images/blog/stretch-and-steady/nearby-not-hovering.webp" alt="Child painting at a kitchen table while a parent works nearby, glancing over with a smile">

    <p>Stretch doesn't mean pushing. It means creating space for them to surprise themselves. The magic is in what you <em>don't</em> do — you don't take over the puzzle, you don't correct the crayon grip, you don't narrate their play.</p>

    <h3>The "Coach from Behind" Move</h3>

    <p>When they hit a wall, the instinct is to swoop in and fix it. Instead:</p>

    <div class="step-cards">
      <div class="step-card">
        <div class="step-num">1</div>
        <div class="step-content">
          <h4>Let them wrestle with it</h4>
          <p>Sit on your hands for a beat longer than feels comfortable</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <div class="step-num">2</div>
        <div class="step-content">
          <h4>Step alongside, not in front</h4>
          <p>Show one small piece of the puzzle — then pull back</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="step-card">
        <div class="step-num">3</div>
        <div class="step-content">
          <h4>Describe what they did</h4>
          <p>Specific observations land; "good job" floats away</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="script-box">
      <span class="script-label">Say this</span>
      "That part's tricky, huh? Watch this one piece — now you try the rest."
    </div>

    <p>And when they get it:</p>

    <div class="script-box">
      <span class="script-label">Say this</span>
      "You kept going even when it wasn't working. That took real patience."
    </div>

    <p>Notice the difference? You're not praising the result. You're naming the effort, the persistence, the quality of attention. That's what builds a kid who tries hard things willingly.</p>

    <h3>Replace "Good Job" with What You Actually See</h3>

    <div class="compare-row">
      <div class="compare-side before">"Good job on that drawing!"</div>
      <div class="compare-arrow">&rarr;</div>
      <div class="compare-side after">"You used six different colors in the sky. I wouldn't have thought of that."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="compare-row">
      <div class="compare-side before">"Great work at practice!"</div>
      <div class="compare-arrow">&rarr;</div>
      <div class="compare-side after">"I saw you go back to that drill three times until you got it."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="compare-row">
      <div class="compare-side before">"You're so smart!"</div>
      <div class="compare-arrow">&rarr;</div>
      <div class="compare-side after">"You figured out that puzzle by testing every piece on the left side first. That was strategic."</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Steady Mode in Action</h2>

    <img class="section-img" src="/images/blog/stretch-and-steady/steady-comfort.webp" alt="Parent sitting on the floor holding a child close, warm light through a window">

    <p>Steady mode is not about fixing. It's not about teaching a lesson. It's about being the warm, calm thing in the room when their world gets too loud.</p>

    <h3>When They're Falling Apart</h3>

    <p>Your presence <em>is</em> the intervention. Get close. Lower your voice. Let them know you're not going anywhere. The lesson comes later — once their body has settled and their brain is back online.</p>

    <div class="script-box">
      <span class="script-label">Say this</span>
      "It looks like something in your chest is really tight right now, like everything got too much all at once."
    </div>

    <p>For kids who struggle to name their feelings, paint the picture instead of slapping a label on it. "You look angry" is less helpful than describing what you actually see happening in their body.</p>

    <h3>When You're About to Lose It</h3>

    <p>You can't be someone else's calm place if you're flooded yourself. It's okay — and actually powerful — to name it and step away.</p>

    <div class="script-box">
      <span class="script-label">Say this</span>
      "I'm feeling overwhelmed right now. I'm going to step into the other room for two minutes and then I'll be right back."
    </div>

    <p>Then come back. The coming back is the part that matters. You're modeling exactly the skill you want them to learn: noticing your limits, taking a pause, and returning to the relationship.</p>
